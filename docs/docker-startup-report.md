## Docker Logs Analysis

✅ **No critical errors found in logs**
✅ **All uvicorn servers started successfully**
✅ **All services listening on expected ports (internal 8000)**

## Network Connectivity

✅ **Docker network 'riptide-test-sites' created successfully**
✅ **All containers connected to network**
✅ **Port mappings configured correctly (5001-5013 → 8000)**

## Identified Issues

### Issue #1: Health Check Failures
- **Cause:** Python 'requests' library not installed in container images
- **Impact:** Docker reports containers as "unhealthy"
- **Severity:** LOW - Services are fully functional
- **Fix Options:**
  1. Add 'requests' to requirements.txt
  2. Use curl for health checks instead

## Recommendations

1. **Update health checks in docker-compose.yml to use curl:**
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
   ```

2. **OR add 'requests' to requirements.txt in each site:**
   ```
   requests==2.31.0
   ```

3. **Remove obsolete 'version' key from docker-compose.yml**

## Summary

| Metric | Status |
|---|---|
| Docker daemon | ✅ RUNNING (Rancher Desktop) |
| Total containers | ✅ 13/13 running |
| Services operational | ✅ 13/13 functional |
| HTTP endpoints | ✅ All responding correctly |
| Network configuration | ✅ Working properly |
| Health checks | ⚠️ Failing (non-critical) |
| Error count | ✅ 0 critical errors |

## Conclusion

All Docker services have been successfully started and are fully operational. The health check failures are cosmetic and do not affect service functionality. Services can be accessed at localhost:5001-5013.
